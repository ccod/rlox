## Rlox language
### a rust implementation of jlox language presented in (Crafting Interpreters)[http://craftinginterpreters.com]

This project only serves as a point of reference to ongoing studies and efforts.
while this may not lead to full on general purpose programming languages in the future, I do
think it will help in thinking about smaller DSLs and their implementations.
