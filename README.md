## Rlox language
### a rust implementation of jlox language presented in [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com)

Very much WIP<br/>
This project only serves as a point of reference to ongoing studies and
efforts.</br>
While this may not lead to full on general purpose programming languages in the future. I do
think it will help in thinking about smaller DSLs and their implementations.
